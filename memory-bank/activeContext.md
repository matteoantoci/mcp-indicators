# Active Context

This document details the current work focus, recent changes, next steps, and active decisions and considerations for the mcp-indicators project.

## Current Work Focus:
Reviewing existing technical indicator implementations and updating memory bank.

## Recent Changes:
- Created the `memory-bank` directory and initialized core memory bank files.
- Examined `src/tools/indicators/sma.ts` to understand indicator tool structure.
- Examined `src/tools/indicators/index.ts` and confirmed that all planned technical indicator tools are already implemented and registered.

## Next Steps:
- Update `memory-bank/progress.md` to reflect the current state of implemented indicators.
- Review all memory bank files for completeness and accuracy based on the current project state.
- Determine the next development steps based on the project brief and the current progress, likely focusing on integration with data sources or testing.
- Present the updated plan to the user.

## Active Decisions and Considerations:
- The core technical indicators are already implemented, shifting the focus to integration and testing.
- Ensuring the memory bank accurately reflects the project's current state is crucial for effective future work.
